<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p>I was born in Dallas, Texas on December 30th 1999, and lived in dallas until I moved to Austin for school. I have spent most of my free time over the past five years playing in a couple different bands around Dallas, and a few shows in Austin. The live music scene in Austin was one of the biggest factors in my decision to attend the University of Texas at Austin, and I'm really looking forward to getting more involved over the next couple of years! <br /><br /></p>
